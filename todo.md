# TODOs
1. create some sort of analysis tool
    - how? and what?
    -- Idea: creat a simple script to calcualte some stuff like max throughput, max power consumption, avg consumption per segmetn etc. etc. (Important: remove speedtest outliers!) (DONE) (improvements in the future?)
2. improve analysis tool from simple script to actual webpage
    -- idea beeing that local tool can save to actual hosted db and then have a dockerized webapp for analysis
    -- much better graph for data few + calculated data + allow some queries?
    -- maybe use some specialized time series database and tools like grafana instead?
3. run the multi port test for all devices we will test (fritzbox needs a rerun, strange outliers etc. huawei done and clean)
3.1. Create simple report of initial findings, the created tool and then send an update mail with repo link and report and quick summary? ALSO update all the tests maybe?
4. run all the remaining tests
5. summarize all the findings and create the report
6. hand in final report + return equipment!
7. Do not forget to write update mails inbetween
8. clean up code
9. publish to github (DONE)

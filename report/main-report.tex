This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the power consumption of network devices in home and Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) environments. We investigate how factors such as network load, the number of connected clients, and connection types (Ethernet vs. Wi-Fi) influence energy usage. Using a dedicated testbed with automated data collection, we evaluate the real-world power efficiency of various consumer-grade, ISP-provided, and business-grade devices. The findings can lead to reducing energy consumption with more energy-efficient network devices and configurations.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\todo{Polish introduction prose. Add: opening paragraph with global energy context (cite IEA/EU stats on ICT energy), narrow down to home/SME CPE devices specifically, clearly state the gap (lack of independent, reproducible measurements), state contribution (custom automated test framework + systematic multi-device analysis), brief outline of report structure.}

This project aims to analyze the power consumption of various network devices commonly used in home and small-to-medium enterprise (SME) environments. The equipment under investigation ranges from consumer-grade home routers to ISP-provided devices and business-grade switches and access points. The goal is to create a comprehensive overview of power consumption across different scenarios and usage patterns.

The analysis will examine several factors that influence power consumption: the number of active Ethernet ports, the number of connected Wi-Fi clients, varying levels of network load and so on. Data will be collected using a smart power meter capable of providing time-based power consumption measurements. This meter is integrated with a monitoring stack (Prometheus and Grafana) to enable automated data collection and visualization.

With this data, we can evaluate the efficiency of these devices under different conditions and identify which configurations are most power-efficient for specific use cases. For example, we can compare whether using an ISP-provided router in bridge mode is more efficient than using a separate router and switch/modem combination. Additionally, the analysis will help determine if some devices should be powered down during periods of low activity, such as overnight, to conserve energy.


\section{Research Questions}
\label{sec:research-questions}
\todo{Consider restructuring RQs into primary (RQ1--RQ3) and secondary (RQ4--RQ9) groups. Add a brief introductory paragraph explaining how these RQs were derived.}
The following research questions guide this investigation:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[\textbf{RQ1}] How does power consumption change with the number of active Ethernet ports?
    \label{rq:ports}
    \item[\textbf{RQ2}] Is there a measurable difference between 100\,Mbps and 1\,Gbps connections, in different load scenarios?
    \label{rq:speed}
    \item[\textbf{RQ3}] How does power consumption scale with network load (idle, 50\%, 100\% utilization of bandwidth)?
    \label{rq:load-scaling}
    \item[\textbf{RQ4}] Which equipment is suitable for continuous operation and which devices have high idle consumption that makes them candidates for automated shutdown during off-peak hours?
    \label{rq:idle-suitability}
    \item[\textbf{RQ5}] How does power consumption per client differ between Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections? Is there a threshold where Wi-Fi becomes more efficient on a per-client basis?
    \label{rq:eth-vs-wifi}
    \item[\textbf{RQ6}] What is the actual impact of power-saving modes on overall power consumption?
    \label{rq:power-saving}
    \item[\textbf{RQ7}] Does the type of connected device (smartphone, laptop, IoT device) or the wireless signal strength (distance to access point) affect power consumption?
    \label{rq:device-type}
    \item[\textbf{RQ8}] Does a device's maximum power consumption rating correlate with its real-world power usage under typical operating conditions, and what does it take to reach that level?
    \label{rq:rated-vs-real}
    \item[\textbf{RQ9}] How efficient is ISP-provided equipment (e.g., Huawei router or Fritzbox 7530) when operating in bridge mode compared to dedicated networking equipment?
    \label{rq:bridge-mode}
    \todo{Decide whether to keep RQ9 or merge with RQ4.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Setup}
\label{sec:setup}
    \subsection{Hardware}
    List of available network devices: (That I have lying around)
    \begin{description}
        \item[Fritzbox 7530] (2018, 802.11ac, 4$\times$ GbE, 18\,W max)
        \item[Asus RT-AX68U] (2020, 802.11ax, 4$\times$ GbE, 33\,W max)
        \item[Alcatel HH40V] (2018, 802.11n, 2$\times$ 100 Mbps, 10\,W max)
        \item[Huawei EchoLife EG8245W5-8T] (2020, 802.11ax, 4$\times$ GbE, 24\,W max)
    \end{description}
    \subsection{Sampling Rate and Accuracy of Power Meter}
    The exact sampling rate of the power meter is not specified in its documentation. However, for the purpose of this analysis, Prometheus is configured to sample data every 10 seconds, which should be sufficient for most tests. The power measurement accuracy is rated at $\pm 100$\,mW for readings below 5\,W and $\pm 2\%$ for readings above 5\,W.
   
    After some testing i found the sampe rate of the power meter to be around once every 2 minutes. This is quite slow and makes it hard to measure short load spikes for example.
    Because of that longer test phases are needed to get meaningful data.

    But i discovered that there exists a workaround to increase the polling rate of the power meter by using the a simple home assistant script that set the power meter to "on" every 15 seconds to get more frequent measurements.

    % code for home assistant script
    \begin{minted}{yaml}
        alias: Automation - Nudge FritzDECT Smart Plug
        description: ""
        triggers:
        - trigger: time_pattern
            seconds: /15
        conditions:
        - condition: state
            entity_id: switch.fritz_dect_200
            state: "on"
        - condition: time
            after: "06:30:00"
            before: "23:59:00"
        actions:
        - action: switch.turn_on
            target:
            entity_id: switch.fritz_dect_200
        mode: single
    \end{minted}

    \subsection{Initial Testing Setup}
    Initial testing setup, shown in figure \ref{fig:initial_network_layout}, uses the Fritzbox to connect to the Power Meter using DECT.
    Then the Fritzbox is connected to my home network such that I can reach the Fritzbox from my NanoPi Neo3.
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/initial_network_layout.png}
            \caption{Initial Network Layout}
            \label{fig:initial_network_layout}
        \end{figure}

    One can already see, in Figure \ref{fig:grafana_power_consumption}, the larger power consumption when running \texttt{iperf} in the first third. Everywhere else the small spikes are something that happens periodically.
    However, I am not able to say what exactly causes these small spikes yet.

        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/grafana_power_consumption.png}
            \caption{Grafana Dashboard showing Fritzbox Power Consumption}
            \label{fig:grafana_power_consumption}
        \end{figure}

    Now the device to test can be connected to the power meter and the Fritzbox can collect the power consumption data.
    Also, the device to test can be connected to the home network and be put under load without interfering with the data collection.
    This was a problem as I initially wanted to test the FritzBox, that is connected to the power meter, itself but that caused data loss due to the API of the Fritzbox being unresponsive under load.

    \subsection{Potential future Setup Ideas}
    Since the FritzBox allows data collection of smart home devices via the TR064 API we can use e.g. gofritz https://github.com/nitram509/gofritz to create a script
    that collects the data while also being able to create load for the testing devices/automate scenarios and therefore create a fully automated testing setup that can also annotate
    the collected data with the current load situation (low load, high load, testing different amount of clients, LAN cables connected, etc.).
    Maybe even a Web UI where one can directly annotate the data for manual testing. Like click button to start and enter Text of test e.g. Connect 5 LAN cables. And then click stop to end the test and maybe also directly export the data and or screenshots of the graphs.

    \subsection{Automating Testing and Data Collection}
    \label{sec:automation}
    \todo{Polish prose into formal academic style throughout this subsection.}
    To enable reproducible, automated measurements, we developed a custom web application with a Go backend and a JavaScript frontend.
    The source code is available at \texttt{github.com/MrCodeEU/jku-master-project-network-devices-power-consumption-analysis}.

    \subsubsection{Architecture Overview}
    The application consists of several components:
    \begin{description}
        \item[Test Runner (\texttt{runner.go})] Orchestrates test execution in three phases: pre-test baseline, load test (with per-interface ramping), and post-test baseline. Each phase duration, interface activation order, and ramp steps are configurable via the web UI.
        \item[Load Generator (\texttt{loadgen.go})] Generates network traffic via UDP flooding, TCP connections, or raw Layer~2 Ethernet frames. Per-interface rate limiting is implemented using a spin-wait loop with nanosecond precision. The generator supports configurable packet sizes, worker counts per interface, and target throughput levels.
        \item[Power Meter Interface (\texttt{fritzbox.go})] Reads real-time power consumption from a FritzBox DECT~200 smart plug via the TR-064 SOAP API, using the \texttt{gofritz} library. A separate FritzBox (not the device under test) is used for data collection to avoid measurement interference.
        \item[Web Server (\texttt{server.go})] Exposes a REST API and serves the frontend. Real-time data streaming to the browser uses Server-Sent Events (SSE). Test results are persisted in an SQLite database with full configuration, time-series data, and computed per-phase statistics.
        \item[Analysis Dashboard (\texttt{analysis.js})] A client-side analysis page that loads test data from the database or imported CSV files. It computes per-phase statistics (average, standard deviation, min/max power and throughput, efficiency in Mbps/W) and renders interactive Chart.js visualizations. Export options include CSV, Excel, and pgfplots-compatible formats for direct use in \LaTeX\ reports.
    \end{description}

    \subsubsection{Load Generation Approach}
    \todo{Add a table comparing TCP vs UDP vs Layer~2 performance.}
    We evaluated three traffic generation methods:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{TCP}: Largely rejected by devices under test; achieved only 60--80\,Mbps as most consumer routers drop or rate-limit unsolicited TCP connections to their management interface.
        \item \textbf{UDP flooding}: The primary method used. Achieves near line-rate throughput (e.g., 3.85\,Gbps aggregate on the Huawei EG8245W5-8T across 4$\times$1\,GbE ports). Uses 1400-byte packets with 16 workers per interface and batched sending (10 packets per sleep cycle).
        \item \textbf{Layer~2 raw frames}: Implemented via \texttt{libpcap} for direct Ethernet frame injection. On Windows, throughput was limited to approximately 550--600\,Mbps due to OS-level packet scheduling constraints.
    \end{itemize}
    UDP flooding was selected as the primary load generation method due to its ability to saturate gigabit links reliably across all tested devices.

    \subsubsection{Power Meter Polling Rate}
    The FritzBox DECT~200 smart plug natively updates its power reading only approximately once every two minutes, which is insufficient for capturing transient power behavior. To increase the effective polling rate, a Home Assistant automation was employed that sends a ``turn on'' command to the already-on smart plug every 15 seconds. This triggers the DECT~200 to refresh its power reading, achieving an effective polling interval of approximately 15 seconds. The test application then queries the updated value via TR-064 every 5 seconds.
    \todo{Add citation for TR-064 protocol specification and gofritz library.}

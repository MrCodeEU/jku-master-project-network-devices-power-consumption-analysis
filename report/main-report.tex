\addsec{Abstract}
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the power consumption of network devices in home and Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) environments. We investigate how factors such as network load, the number of connected clients, and connection types (Ethernet vs. Wi-Fi) influence energy usage. Using a dedicated testbed with automated data collection, we evaluate the real-world power efficiency of various consumer-grade, ISP-provided, and business-grade devices. The findings can lead to reducing energy consumption with more energy-efficient network devices and configurations.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This project aims to analyze the power consumption of various network devices commonly used in home and small-to-medium enterprise (SME) environments. The equipment under investigation ranges from consumer-grade home routers to ISP-provided devices and business-grade switches and access points. The goal is to create a comprehensive overview of power consumption across different scenarios and usage patterns.

The analysis will examine several factors that influence power consumption: the number of active Ethernet ports, the number of connected Wi-Fi clients, varying levels of network load and so on. Data will be collected using a smart power meter capable of providing time-based power consumption measurements. This meter is integrated with a monitoring stack (Prometheus and Grafana) to enable automated data collection and visualization.

With this data, we can evaluate the efficiency of these devices under different conditions and identify which configurations are most power-efficient for specific use cases. For example, we can compare whether using an ISP-provided router in bridge mode is more efficient than using a separate router and switch/modem combination. Additionally, the analysis will help determine if some devices should be powered down during periods of low activity, such as overnight, to conserve energy.


\section{Research Questions}
\label{sec:research-questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How does power consumption change with the number of active Ethernet ports? Is there a measurable difference between 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps connections, in different load scenarios?
    \item How does power consumption scale with network load (idle, 50\%, 100\% utilization of bandwidth)?
    \item Which equipment is suitable for continuous operation and which devices have high idle consumption that makes them candidates for automated shutdown during off-peak hours?
    \item How does power consumption per client differ between Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections? Is there a threshold where Wi-Fi becomes more efficient on a per-client basis?
    \item What is the actual impact of power-saving modes on overall power consumption?
    \item Does the type of connected device (smartphone, laptop, IoT device) or the wireless signal strength (distance to access point) affect power consumption?
    \item Does a device's maximum power consumption rating correlate with its real-world power usage under typical operating conditions, and what does it take to reach that level?
    \item How efficient is ISP-provided equipment (e.g., Energie AG Huawei router) when operating in bridge mode compared to dedicated networking equipment?
\end{itemize}

\section{Setup}
\label{sec:setup}
    \subsection{Hardware}
    List of available network devices: (That I have lying around)
    \begin{description}
        \item[Fritzbox 7530] (2018, 802.11ac, 4$\times$ GbE, 18\,W max)
        \item[Asus RT-AX68U] (2020, 802.11ax, 4$\times$ GbE, 33\,W max)
        \item[Alcatel HH40V] (2018, 802.11n, 2$\times$ GbE, 10\,W max)
        \item[Huawei EchoLife EG8245W5-8T] (2020, 802.11ax, 2$\times$ GbE, 24\,W max)
    \end{description}
    \subsection{Sampling Rate and Accuracy of Power Meter}
    The exact sampling rate of the power meter is not specified in its documentation. However, for the purpose of this analysis, Prometheus is configured to sample data every 10 seconds, which should be sufficient for most tests. The power measurement accuracy is rated at $\pm 100$\,mW for readings below 5\,W and $\pm 2\%$ for readings above 5\,W.
   
    \subsection{Initial Testing Setup}
    Initial testing setup, shown in figure \ref{fig:initial_network_layout}, uses the Fritzbox to connect to the Power Meter using DECT.
    Then the Fritzbox is connected to my home network such that I can reach the Fritzbox from my NanoPi Neo3.
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/initial_network_layout.png}
            \caption{Initial Network Layout}
            \label{fig:initial_network_layout}
        \end{figure}

    One can already see, in Figure \ref{fig:grafana_power_consumption}, the larger power consumption when running \texttt{iperf} in the first third. Everywhere else the small spikes are something that happens periodically.
    However, I am not able to say what exactly causes these small spikes yet.

        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/grafana_power_consumption.png}
            \caption{Grafana Dashboard showing Fritzbox Power Consumption}
            \label{fig:grafana_power_consumption}
        \end{figure}

    Now the device to test can be connected to the power meter and the Fritzbox can collect the power consumption data.
    Also, the device to test can be connected to the home network and be put under load without interfering with the data collection.
    This was a problem as I initially wanted to test the FritzBox, that is connected to the power meter, itself but that caused data loss due to the API of the Fritzbox being unresponsive under load.

    \subsection{Potential future Setup Ideas}
    Since the FritzBox allows data collection of smart home devices via the TR064 API we can use e.g. gofritz https://github.com/nitram509/gofritz to create a script
    that collects the data while also being able to create load for the testing devices/automate scenarios and therefore create a fully automated testing setup that can also annotate
    the collected data with the current load situation (low load, high load, testing different amount of clients, LAN cables connected, etc.).
    Maybe even a Web UI where one can directly annotate the data for manual testing. Like click button to start and enter Text of test e.g. Connect 5 LAN cables. And then click stop to end the test and maybe also directly export the data and or screenshots of the graphs.

\section{Test Setup per Research Question (NEW: since last update)}
\label{sec:test-setup-per-research-question}
    I will now propose one test setup per research qustion and then try out each test setup. One very important change to the initial testing setup described in Figure \ref{fig:initial_network_layout} is that i will be using my PC and its 2.5 GbE NIC to generate load for the devices under test.
    \subsection{How does power consumption change with the number of active Ethernet ports? Is there a measurable difference between 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps connections, in different load scenarios?}

    \textbf{Test Procedure:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Connect the device under test to the power meter
        \item Connect 1, 2, 3, and 4 Ethernet cables from the main PC's NIC to the device under test
        \item For each cable count, test with:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Idle load (no traffic)
            \item 50\% load using iperf3
            \item 100\% load using iperf3
        \end{itemize}
        \item Force connections to 100 Mbps and repeat tests
        \item Force connections to 1 Gbps and repeat tests
        \item Record power consumption data via Fritzbox TR064 API

    \end{figure}

    \textbf{Test Procedure:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Baseline: measure power with no clients connected
        \item Connect 1-4 clients via Ethernet, measure power consumption
        \item Connect 1-4 clients via Wi-Fi (2.4GHz), measure power consumption
        \item Connect 1-4 clients via Wi-Fi (5GHz), measure power consumption
        \item Generate identical network load across all scenarios using iperf3
        \item Calculate power consumption per client for each connection type
    \end{enumerate}

            \item Measure idle power with EEE disabled
            \item Measure under load with EEE enabled/disabled
        \end{itemize}
        \item For devices with Wi-Fi power-saving modes:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Test with various power-saving settings
            \item Measure impact on both device and client power consumption
        \end{itemize}
